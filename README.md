# Get Hooked by Scotland Fury
This is a university project made by [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we make our own 2D platformer in C & C++. We also used the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software, and the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) libraries.

## Subsystems
* The game features several modules that manage the entire game workflow, like textures, renderization, window setup, fonts, etc.
* Both entities and GUI elements are managed by a detailed object tree and modules that handle their logic, fabrication and destruction. Object polymorphism has been exploited to maximum possible efficiency.
* All modules, entities, and GUI elements follow a similar step-by-step workflow. The last two have a second workflow layer, where the conditions like position, movement and inputs are read, a new state is decided, and then all changes are applied.
* All entities are related to the player by radius. Attack, movement, and their logic workflow are conditioned to the player to skip uneeded processes.
* User Interface Elements have a parent and children class so they can be linked through each other for different functions.
* The Button template class is an image with a function pointer which return and parameters can be decided on the creation of the element. This makes the creation of buttons with different functionalities very easy.
* A delta time is embedded into the game, and allows to change from a cap of 30 fps to unlimited.
