# Get Hooked by ch0m5
This is a university project made by a [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) student of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which I make my own platformer in C & C++. I also used the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software, and the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) libraries.

Get Hooked is a platformer game showcasing two levels, basic UI, fluid character movement and controls, Save & Load at any point mid-game, and my first attempt at a deep heriarchy-based entity class system.

Feel free to visit our [Webpage](https://scotland-fury.github.io/Hook_Platformer/).

## Installation
No previous installations is required to play the game, just download and execute the .exe file *Get Hooked* from releases.

## Attention Notice
Because of some minor errors, the game might not initialize on the first execution.

## Usage
### General Controls
* ESC: Open settings menu
* P: Pause the game
* Shift + Up/Down: Change master volume
* Shift + Left/Right: Change music volume

### Player 1 Controls
* Keyboard:
	* Run: A/D
	* Jump: W
	* Crouch/Slide: S
	* Space: Attack

### Debug Mode
* Arrow Keys: Manual Camera Movement
* F1: Start from the first level
* F2: Start from beginning of current level
* F3: Advance to next level
* F4: Free camera movement
* F5: Save current state	(Doesn't work with enemies, coins or the timer)
* F6: Load previously saved state	(Doesn't work with enemies, coins or the timer)
* F7: Recieve instant damage (Unless on godmode)
* F8: User Interface Debug view
* F9: Game debug view (Colliders/Logic)
* F10: Godmode (No damage, no collisions, and free movement)
* F11: Activate/Deactivate FPS cap (30)
* 1/2/3/4/5: Change game scale to number chosen

## Innovation
* Living entities accelerate and deaccelerate when moving, on ground they deaccelerate automatically.
* Entities that are outside the player activation radius do not update.
* Player can attack, a collider is created mid-animation when the attack is visually being made, set by a "start" and "finish" frames.
* Player collider changes shape and position depending on his current animation.
* Player can crouch to evade things that could hit his head area.
* Player slides with a different deacceleration when trying to crouch while moving.
* Player can jump in the air once making a somersault.
* Enemies have a detection and attack radius which they use to input movement and other special attacks.
* Enemies are briefly stunned if still alive, backing off from the player. If they die, they dissapear after a set time.
* Button is a template class with a function pointer that allows easy creation of new and different buttons with different functionalities, as you can decide which return and parameters will their allocated function use.
* Some Original Debug Functionalities.
