# Get Hooked by Scotland Fury
This is a university project made by CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we make our own platformer in C & C++.

Get Hooked is a platformer game featuring great freedom of movement achieved specially by the hook tool that the player possesses and a great focus on the player's inertia. (Hook planned, not implemented yet!)

Release Link: [Get Hooked v0.1](https://github.com/Scotland-Fury/Hook_Platformer/releases/tag/v.0.1)
