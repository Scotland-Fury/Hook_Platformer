# Get Hooked by Scotland Fury
This is a university project made by [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we make our own platformer in C & C++. We also used the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software, and the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) libraries.

Get Hooked is a platformer game featuring great freedom of movement achieved specially by the hook tool that the player possesses and a great focus on the player's inertia. (Hook planned, not implemented yet!)

Feel free to visit our [Webpage](https://scotland-fury.github.io/Hook_Platformer/).

* F11: Activate/Deactivate FPS cap (30)
* 1/2/3/4/5: Change game scale to number chosen

## Innovation
* Living entities accelerate and deaccelerate when moving, on ground they deaccelerate automatically.
* Entities that are outside the player activation radius do not update.
* Player can attack, a collider is created mid-animation when the attack is visually being made, set by a "start" and "finish" frames.
* Player collider changes shape and position depending on his current animation.
* Player can crouch to evade things that could hit his head area.
* Player slides with a different deacceleration when trying to crouch while moving.
* Player can jump in the air once making a somersault.
* Enemies have a detection and attack radius which they use to input movement and other special attacks.
* Enemies are briefly stunned if still alive, backing off from the player. If they die, they dissapear after a set time.
* Some Original Debug Functionalities.
