# Get Hooked by Scotland Fury
This is a university project made by [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we make our own platformer in C & C++. We also used the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software, and the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) libraries.

Get Hooked is a platformer game featuring great freedom of movement achieved specially by the hook tool that the player possesses and a great focus on the player's inertia. (Hook planned, not implemented yet!)

Feel free to visit our [Webpage](https://scotland-fury.github.io/Hook_Platformer/).

## Installation
No previous installations is required to play the game, just download and execute the .exe file *Get Hooked* from releases.

## Innovation
* Player accelerates and deaccelerates when moving on ground, but not while being airborne
* Player collider changes shape and position depending on his current animation
* Player can crouch to evade things that could hit his head area
* Player slides with a different deacceleration when trying to crouch while moving
* Player can jump in the air once making a somersault
* Some Original Debug Functionalities
